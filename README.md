# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Unexpected $unwind Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `$unwind` stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The problem arises when dealing with cases where the array being unwound is empty.  In such scenarios, `$unwind` unintentionally removes the entire document from the results, leading to an incomplete or inaccurate dataset.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that handles empty arrays gracefully, preserving all original documents.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.js` script.  Observe that documents where the `results` array is empty are missing from the output.
3. Run the `bugSolution.js` script. Notice that all documents, including those with empty arrays, are now correctly processed.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true` option within the `$unwind` stage. This ensures that documents with empty arrays are not removed from the pipeline and allows for handling these cases appropriately.
